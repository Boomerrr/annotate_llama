After the most recent update, the app had decided it didn't want to open, and after I tried uninstalling and reinstalling it doesn't download properly.

It's great for messaging and calling even without Discord Nitro. Unfortunately, in my personal experience, AMOLED mode has suddenly stopped working with seemingly no explanation or reason, leaving me stuck with a less appealing theme.	bug report
The multiple new updates suck. It's hard to navigate within the app and especially on Android, there's so many features that are left out. It's absolutely trash to say. It's nice to talk to friends but the whole new updates suck	feature request
It mutes all other app sounds. I am in a long distance relationship, my partner and I are in different time zones, So we spend a lot of time on call, especially during sleep so we feel closer. However I need my phone for alarms for medication, but when we are on a call it mutes my alarms, and any other apps, like texts. It is vital that I have these alarms be able to go off for meds which are taken daily. I don't want to have to get off call with my partner just so my phone works.	bug report
There seems to be a bug where the UI for the app glitches out and locks itself to landscape mode when I'm watching YouTube or playing games and switch to it	bug report

What happened guys? This app used to be so great before this new UI. The only reason I continue to use Discord is because my friends want to call there. The app is very buggy compared to back then.	feature request
I wish the App would let me know if my credit is $0 before I make the call. Or at least prompt me before making a call. It can be annoying when my call got cut off in the middle of the conversation. Overall, call quality is average.	feature request

Did not have a problem until the new update and UI changes. Now I'm not getting notifications of DMs, threads don't load in at the most recent message (or even last read!) but about a screen above that. Switching to the Servers tab is annoying. You'd expect it to leave the list of servers as the first option to select which one you are navigating to, but it doesnt.

So the update took some time to get used to, but every now and then I get this bug where I can't scroll. It will act as if it is stuck and won't scroll up or down. I've been fixing it by going to another channel and then back. Am on a Samsung S23+.	bug report
So far so good. Pretty easy to use.	irrelevant information
I like this app. It's one of the most useful app that you can use for work and also study or gaming. But the fact that it can only handle a 8mb file when you needs to send something to friends or colleagues is very annoying. I mean it would be acceptable like 10 years ago. But now it's quite nonsense.	feature request
This was a 5 star review, ive never seen a company on the fast track to failure the way Discord is. They will make changes no one wanted or asked for that arent relevant in any way to their service all while scamming every last cent out of people like Discord is some gamified social app they can run a micro transaction monopoly through. As soon as Microsoft didn't buy them, all their morals went out the window.	irrelevant information
I just got this app.	irrelevant information
Consistently fails to save images to gallery. Please fix this ASAP. I need to be able to download my work schedules for Starbucks so I don't need an internet connection to view them. In response to developer, I found where it was putting the files, it's in a folder at sdcard/pictures/Groupme, and that does not show up in the Gallery. It HAD been putting them at sdcard/DCIM/Pictures or something like that and that was showing up in the gallery.	bug report

this was a great app, until this recent redesign. The new look is weird and not easy to navigate. Nitro manager is incredibly convoluted, difficult, and frustrating to use. I had 3 months of free Nitro but was automatically charged $10 out of nowhere once it ended and had to jump through so many hoops to even attempt getting a refund. Basically, they made it so once you subscribe, it's next to impossible to unsubscribe thus they'll keep taking your money. This is just one of so many flaws.	feature request
The app is good but in the last update it became rlly laggy and everything is glitchy	bug report

This app works pretty good. I've gotten a lot of spam though and there isn't an option to delete it.	feature request
messages rarely send. text can be typed but disappears when i hit enter	bug report
Terrible forced change. Users want applications that feel fluid when using. Not something that takes away everything that was known and replaces it with what operates extremely different after one change. This forced update to a new layout, that I have yet to see a single person like, was an extremely poor business choice. This will cause Discord from being the place to be to the place that no one wants to hang out on mobile wise for they can't find out how to hang out.	feature request
Really doesn't work on Android. Delay on receiving messages and doesn't update in real time	bug report

I've been using Groupme for years - at least 5. In the last year it's gotten very buggy. It randomly stops notifying that new messages have been sent, it reverts back to much earlier in a chat and tells me I have some ridiculous amount of new comments, like 892, and now it frequently won't send new messages or pictures. The app is starting to become worthless because it's so unreliable. For years it was a good, solid app which eliminated annoying group texts. Please fix my beloved groupme!	bug report

Other then that, the app is back to being as fun and usable as it used to be for me.

5 stars for being able to share  videos	feature request
I just don't like the new layout	feature request
There should be tab that will allow someone to leave the group without the creators help.	feature request
It's been a task to get the full understanding on each server, channel, bots and people of discord. So many times I've felt inadequate because I'm new & trying to learn & maneuver through the system. It's clique-ish in the sense only few will attempt to help a Nube navigate or gain accomplishment. I've felt alone more than I have accepted.	irrelevant information
There a bug where gif is gone together with pic and text i wrote after i post it for few minutes.	bug report

Easy access to our group messages	irrelevant information

Its good after all...the only thing is. why they make another layout something else, while the old one is better..now im a bit struggle when after i update... should bring back the old one layout and menu chat and server, and its a bit laggy..	feature request
"New UI is dumb. I had the option to switch freely until i exited the app, then it was gone and im stuck with this new ""better"" one."	feature request
We use this app to communicate with various church ministries. One Con is that if you make a mistake and wish to delete an app, I find it hard to delete and start over.	irrelevant information
This app used to be really good. The new layout was pointless and hard to get around to find my servers and annoying. Not only that but it's glitching more than it usually does and I have to keep closing the app out just to get the app to work again	bug report
The new update is hot garbage!! Let's try not fixing what's not broken eh?!	irrelevant information
The newest update has made the file and image trays on the bottom of the screen go completely out of view. When I click to add an image or a gif, they trays go below the touchable portion of my screen and I can't do anything.	bug report

Stupid app... nothing works	irrelevant information

your directory search is terrible, slow and unable to find anyone.	bug report
great app I love it! only thing I dislike is its glitchy sometimes as far as not being able to tag certain people in the group. Also trying to send large or high quality videos will fail for me alot	bug report
I am unable to update the app. It's been more than a month. Video quality is bad, and I am unable to make the app silent.	bug report
The new layout is absolutely horrendous. The staff are sitting on a throne of lies because the new UI is NOT faster than the other one, it is about 5 times slower.	feature request
Landline phone calls get cut off frequently and sometimes the other sides can't hear my voice.	bug report
Not good at all..my friend me 4 minutes...video ...i try to save him in my gallery unable to save it ... trying again.But it doesn't work which means it is not perfect app..	bug report
When doing VC my display goes completely black and I can only turn my phone off before turning it back on. It does this every time now, and my friend is saying the new update is causing such bad glitching with messages overall that they can't even use the app anymore. I'm all for little changes, but the old update worked perfectly fine as far as I'm aware. Why change something so drastically if it works overall? I love discord and I'll keep using it, but it's not as inclusive or user friendly.	bug report
No notifications... No settings... App sucks!	feature request

It's so perfect getting to use the app.	irrelevant information
Everytime someone calls me through Skype and I pickup, all of my audio start coming from earpiece. Even after I cut call. Any video I play, its audio will come from earpiece. I need to force stop skype as a solution to this problem which I shouldn't have to do after every call.	bug report

Bring back black mode, I don't want the dark mode from the PC version. Edit: it is resolved	feature request
New UI is so laggy and clunky. It has no flow and crashes constantly. My friends who also use the app send me double messages unintentionally. I wouldn't mind the change if it wasn't so laggy and slow.	bug report
I'm disappointed with the recent update. The UI is unfamiliar with the native desktop app and there have been consistent bugs that make the app unusable, especially when you try to utilize it after your phone has lost connection for even a brief moment of time - previously you could still see recent chat history but now it just shows the chat forever loading. The changes are especially frustrating after using it for connecting with friends and family for so long.	bug report
I would love the messages to be time stamped	feature request
Group Me is a great way to connect with friends, family, co workers and more! I love it!	irrelevant information
I didn't get like 200 messages and this happens from time to time again.	bug report

It's good but the app doesn't give me chat notifications, please work on fixing this	bug report
Meh just another way to connect with family and friends	irrelevant information
Good .....new feature should be added in which we can swicth our accounts .....for personal use and buissness use...	feature request
Horrible new UI	feature request
It asked for to much and it won't let me log in	bug report
After the developers updated the Username change and can't use capital letters anymore. I just flat out stopped using the app and uninstalled and downgrading the app still does not make the prompt go away when trying to change my username, before the update I could change my username and it would ask to verify with a password, now it just prompts me to get nitro every time I try to want to change my username. So basically you ruin the Discord experience	bug report
I can't send picture messages since the app updated	bug report
Very easy to navigate.	irrelevant information
last update for Android is terrible and makes it not usable I cont switch from one chat to another I have to close the app then I get to the different thread	bug report
The app is pretty decent ngl but messages and notifications get hard to deal with one problem I am having is connection to the servers sometimes I will attempt to go to a different server and it will keep me in the same one and when I send messages they don't send until you restart the app and it will show how many times you attempted to send the message when it didn't, that's a big problem so please fix it	bug report
When I'm on call with someone and they leave it won't let me stay on call by myself and it's annoying because I used to do it all the time. Like what if they left because of poor internet or something you shouldn't just hang up the call just like that. You need to allow us to stay on call by ourself for ever how long we like so please fix this.	bug report
Its so slow as the messages never go through to the other person. Also the messages that were deleted are able to still be seen. Please optimize the app for slower devices as thay will make higher end devices experience much better.	bug report
very slow response when trying to input the phone numbers. each digit takes 5 seconds to get a response. over all, the interface is confusing and not very responsive.	bug report

I hate the new update soo bad	irrelevant information
Works but only kinda most of the time I feel like I'm looking at modern art because the video comes in either 360p or 144p it looks like especially if the other person starts moving	bug report
New UI is trash This UI update was absolutely horrible. Not tested enough for stability. Mobile discord is now a hot mess to navigate not even including the times it takes me a day back in any channel or DM. Along with the fact that changing channels doesn't really work either still showing the page you were on even if you change servers entirely. Only an app close and reopen works here.	bug report
Stop asking me to rate your app	irrelevant information
I cant even use it it keeps loading everything and it dont even load please fix this	bug report
More or less works great. The occasional bugs are there but they're often not bad enough for me to remember them. There's quite a difference between the app and desktop mode and there are some features I wish were in both. Does the job fine though	feature request
Masterpiece of how to design something that plays to the strengths of mobile devices	irrelevant information

I tried to verify my phone on Discord, I entered my exact phone number, and my Messages account has the exact same number. I looked at my messages, i!t's not there	bug report
Before you go adding more pointlessly flashy nitro features for the few people still bothering to give you money, you should fix this broken app. I should not have to force quit 5 times a day because your app has a memory leak every time I switch screens in the unintuitive ui you forced on me.	bug report
Gets stuck on one screen. I can scroll up and down but not change servers or rooms/channels within the sercer	bug report
I'm so sorry for giving you just one star, the truth is that I haven't used this app already... Just wanna know if a Nigerian can also access this app... I promise to change it back to 5 stars if it goes well for me.	irrelevant information
I'm in the same boat as everyone else here earlier in the years 2018 was when i first downloaded it the app was alot better and now its nothing but bugs.Personally i like using the mobile app more because you can just use your phone and not have to use a giant desktop or laptop. I have used the desktop version but using mobile is less of a hassle for me but this whole update has pretty much ruined the app hopefully some things will change or get fixed in the future.	bug report
Every so often it completely clears my group chats. Even ones that I was just in and went directly back into to respond. It would be ok if it was once or maybe twice but this is the third or fourth time in less than a year.	bug report
Great app	irrelevant information
The new update sucks- bad. Like I've had this app for a long while and this new update lags everything. It won't send messages and if it does ot send 20+ times in a whole different chat. I've had this happen to be several times and it's ober annoying- that and where the dms are, the notifications for dms don't wanna show up half of the time. And you have to be so cautious because you don't wanna make someone think you're ignoring them because of the notifications.	bug report
Comparing GroupaMe to other team chat apps, I'm not satisfied and I wouldn't use this app if it were my choice. I hope they have the resources and initiative to improve. The desktop (browser) version and the app don't sync well. Read messages are still duplicated as unread, messages sync later, etc. Secondly, functions such as replying to individual messages are missing. Editing messages and uploading multiple images is missing. Beyond liking messages, I'd love to see a thumbs up reaction, etc	bug report
What aa wonderful app	irrelevant information
Helpful, but works horribly on Adroid.	irrelevant information
Worked great on my SG7, but doesn't work on Samsung Galaxy S9. I'm not the only one that is having a problem with it. This needs fixing ASAP!	bug report

While everything else is as good as it was, the appearance has changed for me, and it looks frankly terrible. It used to look so clean and organized, and now everything looks so cluttered and jumbled up. I hope they change it back.	feature request

Stupid app... Cannot play audio files.... It keeps on spinning	bug report
I often don't get a notification or I get it hours after it was sent even with notifications on. Additionally, with this last update I can't save pictures to my phone anymore... Which is really annoying because we receive our work schedules on here.	bug report

Nowadays I'm using Skype. It's wonderful.. but still I'm communicating with different countries and different languages people. Everyone expecting ontime translation.	feature request
Really good experience on pc, on mobile it's harder to use it, navigate trough it. Voice chat on mobile is not perfect, but good enough. Good experience overall	feature request
It was all good before but changing the highlighted blue to that light gray was a TERRIBLE idea. Also for the past 3 months I've been unable to send screenshots within the app, I actually have to go to my phone's gallery and share it to a group from there. It's just an unnecessary blood of inconvenience.	feature request
It's an app that has chat and it works like it should. Discord is better but hey, idgaf so here's 5 stars.	irrelevant information
I just have one problem, sometimes i don't get the notification even after someone tag me and there's no new messages notification, it only show the first new message then after that no newer until we open the app	bug report
It is amazing	irrelevant information
every is good, but it would be much better if they also allowed the option 6zoom in while screen sharing. It becomes extremely difficult to read the screen since they have disabled the zoom in option.	feature request
