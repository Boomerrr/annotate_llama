Assuming you are a software requirements analyst 
you are categorizing user comments into three categories (bug report, feature request, and irrelevant information).
bug report refers to the failure of the original software functionality;
feature request is a structured request applied to software maintenance that implements a new function or enhance existing features;
irrelevant information refers to information that does not contain information that can be applied to software updates.
perpetually not great. aggresively adequate, borderline broken and constantly under-construction.->irrelevant information
Not that good as expectation->irrelevant information
I wish there was a way to send a reminder directly from a calendar event to anyone who hasn't responded. Otherwise, it's great!->feature request
How do you not have the option to delete chats, or even check who has seen your message? Garbage. Do yourself a favor and get WhatsApp. The functionality of this app is atrocious.->feature request
"new ui sucks, cant revert to old one ""we changed it for mobile instead of a scaled down desktop version"" thats literally why we liked the mobile app because it didnt try to feel like a f**ckin mobile app. you cant see full pinned messages or their attachments and the new server menu requires endless scrolling for what used to be a seamless experience with desktop. discord recently has been fixing things that werent broken in the first place and completely ignoring community feedback. why."->feature request
So far, all is good. We use this handy app with our church community.->irrelevant information
Inconvenient interface. Can't delete history->feature request
It has been good.->irrelevant information
Discord is already part of my day-to-day routine. But when it was updated, and I'm on call and trying to open other apps to play while on a VC, I'm automatically disconnected from the call and can't join the VCs unless I'm on the app itself. That's why I can't join calls when trying to play with my friends or I can play but can't join the VC.->bug report
Allows me to stay in touch easily and get information to my teams and activity groups.->irrelevant information
Audio /vedio  cut off  very often->bug report
There is no way to jump to first post. Newest release break my zoom settings/font size->feature request
It's good but please upgrade it so that it can be used without network->feature request
Incredibly broken. Can not have a conversation that lasts more than 30 minutes if typing as Skype starts to lock up. Never used to and no other app does this. It gets incredibly close to phone breaking as it makes my phone's keyboard unusable.->bug report
I've used Discord for 7 years and I've gotten so used to this mobile layout. My app finally automatically updated today, against my own wishes due to what I've heard about the new UI, and I've gotta say I'm confused and disappointed. What happened to swiping left to check the member list? I've gotta tap on the channel name now to check that? Never mind the fact that I can't find any semblance of a friends list anymore, and all of my direct messages are in that new bottom toolbar, unlike on PC.->feature request
Change of review, Discord did managed to respond. So I make a update to my negative review. Hopefully in the future there's improvement for others using Discord ticket service and maybe something better for customer review. Discord is heavy in its system than what it used to be. The Discord call still lags compare to its competitors.->feature request
It's slow to load->bug report
New UI Sucks ALOT i want the old one back this one is too confusing can we have the option back to go to legacy UI? this alone would bring me up to 5->feature request
My screen keeps turning black->bug report
slow loading of conversations and emoticons->bug report
Recent updates is bugging my app. It keeps on lagging (the screen showing one channel despite switching to other channels in the server).->bug report
bring the old UI back I'm in shambles rn->feature request
sometimes it works and other times it doesn't; will drop calls periodically->bug report
Horrible connection, unclear calls, dropped calls. No matter if I'm using wifi or even my mobile data.->bug report
I'm loving it->irrelevant information
After update it has become very glitchy fix that first->bug report
The call history only show the name of contact, without the actual number which is very important. Contact can not edit multiple number with one person. Software poorly designed.->feature request
Love the app. It helps me keep up with all of my boys football schedules while getting a shingle full time working mom who is always busy. Makes life easier->irrelevant information
This is a great app! However, I wish the notifications I received from direct messages were like the ones I get from large groups. I never get any notifications for direct messages and the message isn't in bold either, so it often goes unnoticed by me and I don't realize I received a message until weeks later.->feature request
Easy to use and fun way to communicate with friends!->irrelevant information
Discord: let's change UI every few months to annoy users for no reason->feature request
Delays messages for days!!! I don't get to read or send messages sometimes->bug report
I enjoy the chats..->irrelevant information
2 days ago this would have been a 4 star review but the new update is such a downgrade that I had to say something. Why they always insist on making every feature worse is beyond me->irrelevant information
Easiest way to talk with people online atm.->irrelevant information
Does what it's supposed to do->irrelevant information
everything is nice and all for me but uhhhhhhhh I have my auto rotate off and yet somehow discord can rotate on itself->bug report
"App recently updated and gives Skype a run for its money in the ""worst app overhaul for 0 reason"" category."->irrelevant information
Wont even make video/voice calls, it just stops ringing. Works 50% of the time.->bug report
