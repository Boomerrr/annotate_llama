Assuming you are a software requirements analyst 
you are categorizing user comments into three categories (bug report, feature request, and irrelevant information).
bug report refers to the failure of the original software functionality;
feature request is a structured request applied to software maintenance that implements a new function or enhance existing features;
irrelevant information refers to information that does not contain information that can be applied to software updates.
The call history only show the name of contact, without the actual number which is very important. Contact can not edit multiple number with one person. Software poorly designed.->feature request
I wish there was a way to send a reminder directly from a calendar event to anyone who hasn't responded. Otherwise, it's great!->feature request
"great communication ap for our basketball team. i wish the calendar was more of a ""monthly view"" versus just the event day...great ap though!"->feature request
I'm loving it->irrelevant information
This a good app but there needs to be an edit button option.->feature request
bring the old UI back I'm in shambles rn->feature request
Horrible connection, unclear calls, dropped calls. No matter if I'm using wifi or even my mobile data.->bug report
App is extremely buggy. Sometimes it won't load a group, and notifications don't come half the time->bug report
I enjoy the chats..->irrelevant information
Easiest way to talk with people online atm.->irrelevant information
It has been good.->irrelevant information
sometimes it works and other times it doesn't; will drop calls periodically->bug report
So far, all is good. We use this handy app with our church community.->irrelevant information
2 days ago this would have been a 4 star review but the new update is such a downgrade that I had to say something. Why they always insist on making every feature worse is beyond me->irrelevant information
As a large family...we love it helps keep us informed and in touch!->irrelevant information
Audio /vedio  cut off  very often->bug report
Love the app. It helps me keep up with all of my boys football schedules while getting a shingle full time working mom who is always busy. Makes life easier->irrelevant information
I continously get kicked off the app. And most of the time, when I do manage to log back in, it doesn't show my work groups or any other chat. Or any contacts. And when they're there, they end up disappearing.->bug report
Delays messages for days!!! I don't get to read or send messages sometimes->bug report
Love the new official AMOLED dark theme!->irrelevant information
It's slow to load->bug report
slow loading of conversations and emoticons->bug report
"App recently updated and gives Skype a run for its money in the ""worst app overhaul for 0 reason"" category."->irrelevant information
Incredibly broken. Can not have a conversation that lasts more than 30 minutes if typing as Skype starts to lock up. Never used to and no other app does this. It gets incredibly close to phone breaking as it makes my phone's keyboard unusable.->bug report
everything is nice and all for me but uhhhhhhhh I have my auto rotate off and yet somehow discord can rotate on itself->bug report
"new ui sucks, cant revert to old one ""we changed it for mobile instead of a scaled down desktop version"" thats literally why we liked the mobile app because it didnt try to feel like a f**ckin mobile app. you cant see full pinned messages or their attachments and the new server menu requires endless scrolling for what used to be a seamless experience with desktop. discord recently has been fixing things that werent broken in the first place and completely ignoring community feedback. why."->feature request
How do you not have the option to delete chats, or even check who has seen your message? Garbage. Do yourself a favor and get WhatsApp. The functionality of this app is atrocious.->feature request
Constant updates forcibly adding features i dont want, i dont like, use, amd will never use Bing.->feature request
It's good but please upgrade it so that it can be used without network->feature request
New UI isn't great. Less intuitive and clunky than the old layout->feature request
