Assuming you are a software requirements analyst 
you are categorizing user comments into three categories (bug report, feature request, and irrelevant information).
bug report refers to the failure of the original software functionality;
feature request is a structured request applied to software maintenance that implements a new function or enhance existing features;
irrelevant information refers to information that does not contain information that can be applied to software updates.
Great way to stay in contact with friends and family without the excess of other social media apps.->irrelevant information
Love the app. It helps me keep up with all of my boys football schedules while getting a shingle full time working mom who is always busy. Makes life easier->irrelevant information
it would be a 4 but the update is absolutely horrible. the new layout makes it look so cluttered, and the new call background is just why. it's so bad I can't even.->feature request
It has been good.->irrelevant information
The call history only show the name of contact, without the actual number which is very important. Contact can not edit multiple number with one person. Software poorly designed.->feature request
Cool app but if i log out once and i know the password and try to login many times it always say pass incorrect or some other issues so i make other account and if log out for some personal reasons nd agn try to login it again do that thing i hate this pls it is just me or anyone else discord please make my account come back TvT..->bug report
Not that good as expectation->irrelevant information
Recent updates is bugging my app. It keeps on lagging (the screen showing one channel despite switching to other channels in the server).->bug report
I continously get kicked off the app. And most of the time, when I do manage to log back in, it doesn't show my work groups or any other chat. Or any contacts. And when they're there, they end up disappearing.->bug report
perpetually not great. aggresively adequate, borderline broken and constantly under-construction.->irrelevant information
slow loading of conversations and emoticons->bug report
Love the new official AMOLED dark theme!->irrelevant information
I wish there was a way to send a reminder directly from a calendar event to anyone who hasn't responded. Otherwise, it's great!->feature request
It's slow to load->bug report
As a large family...we love it helps keep us informed and in touch!->irrelevant information
It's a great way to communicate coworkers. And very easy to use->irrelevant information
App is extremely buggy. Sometimes it won't load a group, and notifications don't come half the time->bug report
"great communication ap for our basketball team. i wish the calendar was more of a ""monthly view"" versus just the event day...great ap though!"->feature request
Delays messages for days!!! I don't get to read or send messages sometimes->bug report
After update it has become very glitchy fix that first->bug report
There is no way to jump to first post. Newest release break my zoom settings/font size->feature request
This is a great app! However, I wish the notifications I received from direct messages were like the ones I get from large groups. I never get any notifications for direct messages and the message isn't in bold either, so it often goes unnoticed by me and I don't realize I received a message until weeks later.->feature request
Constant updates forcibly adding features i dont want, i dont like, use, amd will never use Bing.->feature request
"Not a fan of this new phone app layout. Why is my friends list under "" you "" tab"->feature request
